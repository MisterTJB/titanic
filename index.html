                    <p>The purpose of our lesson today is to train an Artificial Neural Network to categorise Titanic passengers as <em>survivors</em> or <em>non-survivors</em> based on the information that can be retrieved from the ship's manifest. Our ultimate goal is to use our Neural Net to determine if Jack and Rose — had they been real passengers — would have survived.</p>

                    <p>Glad you asked! There are 11 columns in the dataset. If you have Excel on your computer, you can open <code>titanic_dataset.csv</code> to see what it looks like.</p>
